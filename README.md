The goal here is to predict cardiac abnormalities from 12-Lead ECG signal recorded from 6800 patients. First, we extracted features from ECG signals of each subject. Number of cardiac abnormalities (output classes) here is 9. Then, we used deep learning to train the dataset on each calss. Recorded the model with joblib command to be used for the challenge testing data.
